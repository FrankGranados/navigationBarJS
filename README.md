# Html, Css & Javascript School
This code is part of a series of practical exercises for my learning Html, Css and Javascript.

### Responsive design
This is the design of a responsive web page, if you interact with the width of the window you will notice that the design adapts to the size of the same.

<img src=".\images\screen+600.png" alt="screen+600" style="zoom: 67%;" />

With a width less than 600px, the layout adapts.

<img src=".\images\screen-600.png" alt="screen-600" style="zoom:67%;" />

Not only the general layout, but also the navigation bar, which changes from being in the header to being a sidebar.

<img src=".\images\responsive-sidebar.png" style="zoom:67%;" />

As an addition, in the footer of the page social network icons were added, which interact when hovering over them.
